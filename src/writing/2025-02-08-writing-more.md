    Why I need to write more (and maybe you do too).
slug: writing

I don’t write very well, and I’m not going to lie and say that I do. I often end up writing much shorter paragraphs and essays than I would like, frequently leaving out crucial information needed to fully develop my points for one reason or another.

My writing ability probably hasn’t changed much for a while, maybe even since early high school.

In high school, I wasn’t challenged to write in any meaningful way. All of our writing followed a teacher-provided structure for five-paragraph essays. As we progressed in class, they added more complexity to the format -- counterarguments, intermediate claims, and other elements. But we never really got into constructing our own arguments. I also don’t think I ever received good feedback. There’s no real skill development when all you’re doing is putting your claims and points into a pre-determined, cookie-cutter format.

A skill can’t develop if it’s never practiced. So, I need to write more.

Do you need to write more?

## Afterword

One thing established writers can do is stylistically choose when to follow certain rules. This isn’t limited to only great writers, but writers who truly understand the rules. Without knowing how to write, I can’t choose which rules to disregard.

In my writing, I hope to explore new styles -- maybe one day finding one that I enjoy.
