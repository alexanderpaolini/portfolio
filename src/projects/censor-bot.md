A robust Discord bot designed to automatically filter and delete inappropriate or disallowed words/phrases from chat. This bot is widely used to maintain safe environments in Discord communities.

### Key Features

- Built a sophisticated filtering mechanism using Regex to detect offensive language and prevent common bypass techniques.
- The filter handles diacritical marks and Unicode lookalike characters to avoid false positives.
- Implemented in Node.js with TypeScript, using Express.js for the web interface.
- Contributed to the development of a tool used by over 100,000 communities.

### What I Learned

- Advanced use of regular expressions for language filtering.
- Working with Git and Docker in a large-scale development workflow.
- Real-time data handling and filtering for large user bases.
