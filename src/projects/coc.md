**Competitive Online Coding** is a platform where players compete against each other by solving LeetCode-style coding challenges in real-time. The goal is to be the fastest to solve the problem and win the game!

This project was built using **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend, enabling smooth user interactions and server-side logic. Real-time communication between players is handled via **WebSocket**, providing a seamless multiplayer experience. To enhance the gameâ€™s dynamic nature, the **OpenAI API** is integrated, allowing for the generation of coding challenges that change every time players compete.

### Key Features

- ReactJS frontend and Express.js backend to manage user interactions and server-side logic.
- WebSocket integration for real-time multiplayer communication, ensuring a smooth competitive environment.
- OpenAI API integration for dynamically generated coding challenges.
- Multiplayer environment with lobby creation and player matchmaking.

### Challenges

- Developing a multiplayer system in a hackathon setting, which involved rapid prototyping and quick problem-solving.
- Managing real-time interactions and ensuring smooth gameplay under tight deadlines.
- Efficient task delegation and collaboration to meet time constraints and deliver a polished product.

### Lessons Learned

- Gained experience with WebSocket for real-time communication in multiplayer games.
- Integrated third-party APIs (OpenAI) to enhance user experience with dynamically generated content.
- Improved teamwork and project management skills, learning to collaborate effectively under pressure.
